SPA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The management of spas involves diverse tasks that, when performed manually, can be time consuming and prone to errors. Having worked in several spas, I experienced firsthand the inefficiency of using Excel sheets, calculator, looking for lost papers, and handwriting notes for managing appointments, billing, and inventory. These methods not only consumed significant time but also increased the possibility of errors.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a desktop application that integrates various spa management functions into a single system. The application use Java (JavaFX library), and SQLite for database management. Key features will include a client, staff, inventory, appointment, and financial transactions management system visualized in an interface.
By compacting these functions, the application will not only improve the efficiency of spa operations but also enhance client experience.
